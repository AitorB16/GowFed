# TensorFlow Federated Collaborations

## Welcome!

One of the key goals for TensorFlow Federated is to serve as a platform for
collaborations and joint development in the open between Google and the OSS
community and industry partners.

The purpose of this GitHub directory, and documents linked from here, is to
bootstrap an initial lightweight and open process for jointly evolving TFF. We
will capture here conversations about project scoping, planning, logistics, and
design, product and development roadmaps jointly developed with partners, and
pointers to components maintained by community contributors. Notes from these
conversations will be incorporated here on a weekly basis, and made open and
publicly accessible by all interested parties. We will eventually evolve and
scale out the process, form workgroups, etc., as needed.

If you'd like to join these conversations, please email tff-hello(at)google.com
to introduce yourself and tell us a few words about how you would like to
contribute to the TFF ecosystem. The expectation of all participants is to make
regular engineering contributions.
